# Matchmaker-Project

For my Advanced Topic Finite Math Model Modelling class in high school, I created a matchmaker algorithm based off of OKCupid's matchmaking algorithm. I had a number of my classmates fill out a Google Form with 30 questions--each question asked the person to answer the question for themselves, how they would want their ideal partner to answer it, and how important the question was to them overall. I then returned a list of the top 5 matches using the geometric mean, the top 5 matches using the arithmetic mean, and the top 5 matches purely based off similar answers. I coded the whole project in Java.
